{"year": 1975, "title": "Sholay", "movie_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholay", "paras": ["Sholay (Hindustani:\u00a0[\u02c8\u0283o\u02d0le\u02d0] (listen), transl.\u2009Embers) is a 1975 Indian Hindi-language action-adventure film directed by Ramesh Sippy, produced by his father G. P. Sippy, and written by Salim\u2013Javed. The film is about two criminals, Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Amitabh Bachchan), hired by a retired police officer (Sanjeev Kumar) to capture the ruthless dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan). Hema Malini and Jaya Bhaduri also star, as Veeru and Jai's love interests, Basanti and Radha, respectively. The music was composed by R D Burman.\n", "The film was shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, in the southern state of Karnataka, over a span of two and a half years. After the Central Board of Film Certification mandated the removal of several violent scenes, Sholay was released with a length of 198\u00a0minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204\u00a0minutes became available on home media. When first released, Sholay received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran for more than five years at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. The film was also an overseas success in the Soviet Union. It was the highest-grossing Indian film ever at the time, and was the highest-grossing film in India up until Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994). By numerous accounts, Sholay remains one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time, adjusted for inflation.\n", "Sholay is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential Indian film of all time. It was ranked first in the British Film Institute's 2002 poll of \"Top 10 Indian Films\" of all time. In 2005, the judges of the 50th Filmfare Awards named it the Best Film of 50 Years. The film is a Dacoit Western (sometimes called a \"Curry Western\"), combining the conventions of Indian dacoit films with that of Spaghetti Westerns along with elements of Samurai cinema. Sholay is also a defining example of the masala film, which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory. The combined sales of the original soundtrack, scored by R. D. Burman, and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural memes and becoming part of India's daily vernacular. In January 2014, Sholay was re-released to theatres in the 3D format.\n", "Jai and Veeru are small-time crooks who are released from prison, where they are recruited by a former Inspector Thakur Baldev Singh to capture a notorious dacoit named Gabbar Singh wanted for \u20b950,000,[b] as the duo had saved Thakur from a train robbery which makes Thakur to recruit them for the mission with an additional \u20b920,000 reward. The duo leave for Thakur's village in Ramgarh, where Gabbar is residing and terrorizing the villagers. \n", "After reaching Ramgarh, Veeru falls for Basanti, a feisty talkative horse-cart driver. Jai meets Thakur's widowed daughter-in-law Radha and falls for her, who later accepts his feelings. The two thwarts Gabbar's dacoits, who came to extort money. During the festival of Holi, Gabbar's gang attacks the villagers where they corner Jai and Veeru, but the duo manage to attack and chase them away from the village. The duo are upset at Thakur's inaction (when Jai and Veeru were cornered, Thakur had a gun within his reach, but does not help them) and consider calling off the mission. Thakur reveals that few years ago, Gabbar had killed his family members (except Radha), and had both his arms cut off, where he concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl, which is the sole reason why he could not use the gun. \n", "Realizing this, Jai and Veeru take an oath that they will capture Gabbar alive. After learning the duo's heroics, Gabbar kills the local imam Rahim Chacha's son Ahmed and forces the villagers to make Jai and Veeru surrender to him. The villagers refuse and instead get the duo to kill few of Gabbar's henchmen. Gabbar retaliates by having his men capture Veeru and Basanti. Jai arrives and attacks the hideout, where the trio are able to flee Gabbar's hideout with dacoits in pursuit. Shooting from behind a rock, Jai and Veeru nearly run out of ammunition. Unaware that Jai was wounded in the gunfight, Veeru is forced to leave for more ammunition and also to drop Basanti at a safe place. \n", "Jai sacrifices himself by using his last bullet to ignite dynamite sticks on a bridge from close range, killing Gabbar's men. Veeru returns, and Jai dies, leaving Radha and Veeru devastated. Enraged, Veeru attacks Gabbar's den and kills his remaining men where he catches Gabbar and nearly beats him to death. Thakur appears and reminds Veeru of the vow to hand over Gabbar alive. Thakur uses his spike-soled shoes to severely injure Gabbar and his hands. The police arrive and arrest Gabbar for his crimes. After Jai's funeral, Veeru leaves Ramgarh and finds Basanti waiting for him on the train.\n", "The screenwriter pair Salim\u2013Javed, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar, began narrating the idea for Sholay as a four-line snippet to filmmakers in 1973.[11][12] The idea was rejected by two producer/director teams, including directors Manmohan Desai and Prakash Mehra.[12] About six months after the release of Zanjeer (1973),[c] Salim-Javed contacted G. P. Sippy and his son Ramesh Sippy,[11] and narrated the four-line snippet to them.[12] Ramesh Sippy liked the concept of Sholay and hired them to develop it. The original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge the murder of his family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that it would be difficult to get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances.[12] The film's script and dialogues are in Hindustani;[13] Salim-Javed wrote the dialogues in Urdu script, which was then transcribed by an assistant into Devanagari script so that Hindi readers could read the Urdu dialogues.[14]\n", "The film's plot was loosely styled after Akira Kurosawa's 1954 samurai cinema film, Seven Samurai.[15][16] Sholay is a defining example of the Dacoit Western film, combining the conventions of Indian dacoit films, especially Mehboob Khan's Mother India (1957) and the Dilip Kumar and Nitin Bose film Gunga Jumna (1961),[17] with that of Westerns,[15][16] especially Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns such as Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) as well as The Magnificent Seven (1960).[16] It also has some plot elements borrowed from the Indian films Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971) and Khote Sikkay (1973).[12] A scene depicting an attempted train robbery was inspired by a similar scene in Gunga Jumna,[18] and has also been compared to a similar scene in North West Frontier (1959).[19] A scene showing the massacre of Thakur's family has been compared with the massacre of the McBain family in Once Upon a Time in the West.[20] Sholay may have also been influenced by Sam Peckinpah's Westerns, such as The Wild Bunch (1969) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973), and George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969).[21]\n", "The character Gabbar Singh was modelled on a real-life dacoit of the same name who had menaced the villages around Gwalior in the 1950s. Any policeman captured by the real Gabbar Singh had his ears and nose cut off, and was released as a warning to other policemen.[22][23] Gabbar Singh was also influenced by larger-than-life characters in Pakistani author Ibn-e-Safi's Urdu novels,[24] Dilip Kumar's dacoit character Gunga from the film Gunga Jumna who speaks with a similar mixed Khariboli and Awadhi dialect,[25] and villains from Sergio Leone's films.[26] Sippy wanted to do away with the clich\u00e9d idea of a man becoming a dacoit due to societal issues, as was the case in other films, and focused on Gabbar being an emblem of pure evil. To emphasise the point of Gabbar being a new type of villain, Sippy avoided the typical tropes of dacoits wearing dhotis and pagris and sporting a Tika and worshipping \"Ma Bhavani\"; Gabbar would be wearing army fatigues.[27] The character of the jailer, played by Asrani was influenced by Adolf Hitler. Javed Akhtar brought a book on World War II which had several pictures of Hitler posing to set the typical posture of the character in the film. Asrani spiced up his character with some ideas about Hitler's speech delivery he had heard from a teacher in FTII. The trademark 'Ha Ha' at the end of his monologues was inspired by a similar performance by Jack Lemmon in The Great Race.[28][29] Soorma Bhopali, a minor comic relief character, was based on an acquaintance of actor Jagdeep, a forest officer from Bhopal named Soorma. The real-life Soorma eventually threatened to press charges when people who had viewed the film began referring to him as a woodcutter.[30] The main characters' names, Jai and Veeru, mean \"victory\" and \"heroism\" in Hindi.[31]\n", "The producers considered Danny Denzongpa for the role of bandit chief Gabbar Singh, but he could not accept it as he was committed to act in Feroz Khan's Dharmatma (1975), under production at the same time.[32] Amjad Khan, who was the second choice, prepared himself for the part by reading the book Abhishapta Chambal, which told of the exploits of Chambal dacoits. The book was written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri, the father of fellow cast member Jaya Bhaduri.[33] Sanjeev Kumar also wanted to play the role of Gabbar Singh, but Salim-Javed \"felt he had the audience's sympathy through roles he'd done before; Gabbar had to be completely hateful.\"[11]\n", "Sippy wanted Shatrughan Sinha to play the part of Jai, but there were already several big stars signed, and Amitabh Bachchan, who was not very popular yet, lobbied hard to get the part for himself.[12] He was cast after Salim-Javed recommended him for Sholay in 1973; Bachchan's performance in their first collaboration, Zanjeer, convinced Salim-Javed he was the right actor for the part.[34] Salim-Javed were also impressed with Bachchan's performance in Raaste Kaa Patthar (1972), and at Bachchan's request, Dharmendra had personally put in a word for him. All these factors ensured that the role was Bachchan's.[35]\n", "As cast members had read the script ahead of time, many were interested in playing different parts. Pran was considered for the role of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy thought Sanjeev Kumar was a better choice.[36] Initially, Salim-Javed approached Dilip Kumar to play Thakur's role, but he turned down the offer; Dilip Kumar later said it was one of the few films he regretted turning down.[11] Initially, Dharmendra was also interested to play the role of Thakur. He eventually gave up the role when Sippy informed him that Sanjeev Kumar would play Veeru if that happened, and would thus be paired with Hema Malini, who Dharmendra was trying to woo. Dharmendra knew that Kumar was also interested in Malini.[37] Malini was reluctant to play the role of a tangewali, more so after Sippy told her that the film belongs to Sanjeev Kumar and Amjad Khan, but she trusted Sippy to give her a meaty role, given that he had played a huge role in essaying her stardom through their previous collaborations.[38]\n", "During the film's production, four of the leads became romantically involved.[16] Bachchan married Bhaduri four months before filming started. This led to shooting delays when Bhaduri became pregnant with their daughter Shweta. By the time the film released, she was pregnant with their son Abhishek. Dharmendra had begun courting Malini during their earlier film Seeta Aur Geeta (1972), also directed by Sippy, and used the location shoot of Sholay to further pursue her. During their romantic scenes, Dharmendra would often pay the light boys to spoil the shot, thereby ensuring many retakes which would allow him to spend more time with her. The couple married five years after the film's release.[39]\n", "Much of Sholay was shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, a town near Bangalore, Karnataka.[40][41] The filmmakers had to build a road from the Bangalore highway to Ramanagara for convenient access to the sets.[42] Art director Ram Yedekar had an entire township built on the site. A prison set was constructed near Rajkamal Studios in Bombay, also outdoors, to match the natural lighting of the on-location sets.[43] One part of Ramanagara was for a time called \"Sippy Nagar\" as a tribute to the director of the film.[44] As of 2010[update], a visit to the \"Sholay rocks\" (where much of the film was shot) was still being offered to tourists travelling through Ramanagara.[45]\n", "Filming began on location on 3 October 1973, with a scene featuring Bachchan and Bhaduri.[46] The film had a lavish production for its time (with frequent banquets and parties for the cast),[47] took two and a half years to make, and went over budget. One reason for its high cost was that Sippy re-filmed scenes many times to get his desired effect. \"Yeh Dosti\", a 5-minute song sequence, took 21\u00a0days to shoot, two short scenes in which Radha lights lamps took 20\u00a0days to film because of lighting problems, and the shooting of the scene in which Gabbar kills the imam's son lasted 19\u00a0days.[48] The train robbery sequence, shot on the Bombay\u2013Poona railway route near Panvel, took more than 7\u00a0weeks to complete.[49]\n", "Sholay was the first Indian film to have a stereophonic soundtrack and to use the 70\u00a0mm widescreen format.[50] However, since actual 70\u00a0mm cameras were expensive at the time, the film was shot on traditional 35\u00a0mm film and the 4:3 picture was subsequently converted to a 2.2:1 frame.[51] Regarding the process, Sippy said, \"A 70\u00a0mm [sic] format takes the awe of the big screen and magnifies it even more to make the picture even bigger, but since I also wanted a spread of sound we used six-track stereophonic sound and combined it with the big screen. It was definitely a differentiator.\"[52] The use of 70\u00a0mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the CinemaScope logo. Film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before; one of them added the tagline: \"The greatest star cast ever assembled\u00a0\u2013 the greatest story ever told\".[53]\n", "The director's original cut of Sholay has a different ending in which Thakur kicks Gabbar onto a nail on one of the two poles that Gabbar had used to chain Thakur when he had cut off his arms, stabbing him in the back and killing him, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the imam's son is killed, were cut from the film by India's Censor Board, as was the scene in which Thakur's family is massacred.[48] The Censor Board was concerned about the violence, and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely.[54] Although Sippy fought to keep the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot the ending of the film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar.[55] The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, unedited cut of the film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990.[51] Since then, Eros International has released two versions on DVD. The director's cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204\u00a0minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198\u00a0minutes long.[1][51][56][a]\n", "Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory.[58]\n", "Koushik Banerjea, a sociologist in the London School of Economics, notes that Sholay exhibits a \"sympathetic construction of 'rogue' masculinity\" exemplified by the likeable outlaws Jai and Veeru.[59] Banerjea argues during the film, the moral boundary between legality and criminality gradually erodes.[60] Film scholar Wimal Dissanayake agrees that the film brought \"a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order\" to Indian cinema.[61] Film scholar M. Madhava Prasad states that Jai and Veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society.[62] Prasad says that, through the elements of revenge included in the plot and the application of Jai and Veeru's criminality for the greater good, the narrative reflects reactionary politics, and the audience is compelled to accept feudal order.[62] Banerjea explains that though Jai and Veeru are mercenaries, they are humanised by their emotional needs. Such dualism makes them vulnerable, in contrast to the pure evil of Gabbar Singh.[60]\n", "Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, was well received by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty.[61] Dissanayake explains that the audience was fascinated by the dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama.[61] He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited.[63] He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy.[63] Dissanayake argues that Sholay can be viewed as a national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India.[64] The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.[65]\n", "Dissanayeke and Sahai note that, although the film borrowed heavily from the Hollywood Western genre, particularly in its visuals, it was successfully \"Indianised\".[66] As an example, William van der Heide has compared a massacre scene in Sholay with a similar scene in Once Upon a Time in the West. Although both films were similar in technical style, Sholay emphasised Indian family values and melodramatic tradition, while the Western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach.[20] Maithili Rao, in Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema, notes that Sholay infuses the style of the Western genre into a \"feudalistic ethos\".[67] Ted Shen of the Chicago Reader notes Sholay's \"hysterical visual style\" and intermittent \"populist message\".[68] Cultural critic and Islamic scholar Ziauddin Sardar lampoons the film in his book The Secret Politics of Our Desires: Innocence, Culpability and Indian Popular Cinema, both for its caricature and stereotyping of Muslim and women characters, and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers.[69] Sardar notes that the two most prominent Muslim characters in the film are Soorma Bhopali (a buffoonish criminal), and an impotent victim of the bandits (the imam). Meanwhile, the sole function of one female character (Radha) is to suffer her fate in silence, while the other female lead (Basanti) is just a garrulous village belle.[69]\n", "Some scholars have indicated that Sholay contains homosocial themes.[70][71] Ted Shen describes the male bonding shown in the film as bordering on camp style.[68] Dina Holtzman, in her book Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora, states that the death of Jai, and resultant break of bonding between the two male leads, is necessary for the sake of establishing a normative heterosexual relationship (that of Veeru and Basanti).[72]\n", "R. D. Burman composed the film's music, and the lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi. The songs used in the film, and released on the original soundtrack are listed below.[73] Following that is a list of unused tracks and dialogues which were released later on an updated soundtrack.[74]\n", "The song \"Mehbooba Mehbooba\" was sung by its composer, R. D. Burman, who received his sole Filmfare Award nomination for playback singing for his effort. The song, which is often featured on Bollywood hit song compilations,[75] is based on \"Say You Love Me\" by Greek singer Demis Roussos.[19]\n", "\"Mehbooba Mehbooba\" has been extensively anthologised, remixed, and recreated.[76] A version was created in 2005 by the Kronos Quartet for their Grammy-nominated album You've Stolen My Heart, featuring Asha Bhosle.[77] It was also remixed and sung by Himesh Reshammiya, along with Bhosle, in his debut acting film Aap Kaa Surroor (2007). \"Yeh Dosti\" has been called the ultimate friendship anthem.[78][79] It was remixed and sung by Shankar Mahadevan and Udit Narayan for the 2010 Malayalam film Four Friends,[80] and also in 2010 it was used to symbolise India's friendship with the United States during a visit from President Barack Obama.[81]\n", "Several songs from the soundtrack were included in the annual Binaca Geetmala list of top filmi songs. \"Mehbooba Mehooba\" was listed at No.\u00a024 on the 1975 list, and at No.\u00a06 on the 1976 list. \"Koi Haseena\" was listed at No.\u00a030 in 1975, and No.\u00a020 in 1976. \"Yeh Dosti\" was listed at No.\u00a09 in 1976.[82] Despite the soundtrack's success, at the time, the songs from Sholay attracted less attention than the film's dialogue\u2014a rarity for Hindi language films. The producers were thus prompted to release records with only dialogue.[83][84] Taken together, the album sales reached an unprecedented 500,000\u00a0units.[85] By 1979, the soundtrack went Platinum[86] (equivalent to 1\u00a0million sales at the time),[87] becoming one of the top-selling Bollywood soundtracks of the 1970s.[88]\n", "Music critic Oli Marlow reviewed the soundtrack in 2013, calling it a unique fusion of religious, folk, and classical music, with influences from around the world. He also commented on the sound design of the film, calling it psychedelic, and saying that there was \"a lot of incredible incidental music\" in the film that was not included in the soundtrack releases.[89] In a 1999 paper submitted to London's Symposium on Sound in Cinema, film critic Shoma A. Chatterji said, \"Sholay offers a model lesson on how sound can be used to signify the terror a character evokes. Sholay is also exemplary in its use of soundmatching to jump cut to a different scene and time, without breaking the continuity of the narrative, yet, intensifying the drama.\"[90]\n", "Sholay was released on 15 August 1975, Indian Independence Day, in Bombay. Due to lackluster reviews and a lack of effective visual marketing tools, it saw poor financial returns in its first two weeks. From the third week, however, viewership picked up owing to positive word of mouth.[91] During the initial slow period, the director and writer considered re-shooting some scenes so that Amitabh Bachchan's character would not die. When business picked up, they abandoned this idea.[92] After being helped additionally by a soundtrack release containing dialogue snippets,[60] Sholay soon became an \"overnight sensation\".[50] The film was then released in other distribution zones such as Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, and Hyderabad on 11 October 1975.[93] It became the highest-grossing Hindi language film of 1975, and film ranking website Box Office India has given the film a verdict of \"All Time Blockbuster\".[94]\n", "Sholay went on to earn a still-standing record of 60 golden jubilees[d] across India,[50] and was the first film in India to celebrate a silver jubilee[e] at over 100 theatres.[50] It was shown continuously at Bombay's Minerva theatre for over five years.[15] Sholay was the Indian film with the longest theatrical run until Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) broke its record of 286 weeks in 2001.[95][96]\n", "Exact figures are not available on the budget and box-office earnings of Sholay, but film trade sources provide estimates of its success. According to Box Office India, Sholay earned about \u20b9150 million in net income[f] (valued at about US$16,778,000 in 1975)[b] in India during its first run,[98] which was many times its \u20b930\u00a0million (valued at about US$3,355,000 in 1975)[b] budget.[2][98] Those earnings in India were a record that remained unbroken for nineteen years, which is also the longest amount of time that a film has held the record for being the highest grossing film in India. Its original gross was increased further with re-releases during the late 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.[99] The film's total gross revenue in India amounted to \u20b9350 million[3][100] ($39.15 million).[b] Box Office India estimates the film's total footfalls in India as over 100\u00a0million tickets sold.[101] The film was also an overseas success in the Soviet Union, where it was released in 1979.[102] The film sold 48.4\u00a0million tickets during its initial run at the Soviet box office,[103] before eventually selling 60\u00a0million tickets including re-runs.[104] The film was also released in China, as two parts in 1988.[105]\n", "It was the highest-grossing Indian film ever up until Disco Dancer (1982),[106] and the highest-grossing film in India up until Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994).[3] In 1985, India Today estimated that the film drew a total audience of 250\u00a0million over the years,[4] which is comparable to the number of tickets sold by some of the world's highest-grossing films of all time adjusted for inflation.[107] It is often cited that, after adjusting the figures for inflation, Sholay remains one of the highest-grossing films in the history of Indian cinema, although such figures are not known with certainty.[108] Box Office India estimated \u20b91.63 billion as Sholay's adjusted domestic net income in 2008,[f][109] while Times of India estimated over \u20b93 billion as the adjusted domestic gross in 2009.[110] Mid-Day estimated the film's total adjusted gross as \u20b915 billion ($246 million) in 2014.[111]\n", "Initial critical reviews of Sholay were negative. Among contemporary critics, K.L. Amladi of India Today called the film a \"dead ember\" and \"a gravely flawed attempt\".[112] Filmfare said that the film was an unsuccessful mincing of Western style with Indian milieu, making it an \"imitation western\u2014neither here nor there.\"[112] Others labelled it as \"sound and fury signifying nothing\" and a \"second-rate take-off\" of the 1971 film Mera Gaon Mera Desh.[96] Trade journals and columnists initially called the film a flop.[113] In a 1976 article in the journal Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, author Michael Gallagher praised the technical achievement of the film, but otherwise criticised it stating, \"As a spectacle it breaks new ground, but on every other level it is intolerable: formless, incoherent, superficial in human image, and a somewhat nasty piece of violence\".[114]\n", "Over time, the critical reception to Sholay greatly improved; it is now considered a classic, and among the greatest Hindi-language films.[16][115] In a 2005 BBC review, the well-rounded characters and simple narrative of the film were commended, but the comical cameos of Asrani and Jagdeep were considered unnecessary.[116] On the film's 35th anniversary, the Hindustan Times wrote that it was a \"trailblazer in terms of camera work as well as music,\" and that \"practically every scene, dialogue or even a small character was a highlight.\"[117] In 2006, The Film Society of Lincoln Center described Sholay as \"an extraordinary and utterly seamless blend of adventure, comedy, music and dance\", labelling it an \"indisputable classic\".[118] Chicago Review critic Ted Shen criticised the film in 2002 for its formulaic plot and \"slapdash\" cinematography, and noted that the film \"alternates between slapstick and melodrama\".[68] In their obituary of the producer G.P. Sippy, The New York Times said that Sholay \"revolutionized Hindi filmmaking and brought true professionalism to Indian script writing\".[15]\n", "Sholay was nominated for nine Filmfare Awards, and the only winner was M. S. Shinde, who won the award for Best Editing.[119] The film also won three awards at the 1976\u00a0Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards (Hindi section): \"Best Actor in Supporting Role\" for Amjad Khan, \"Best Cinematographer (Colour)\" for Dwarka Divecha, and \"Best Art Director\" for Ram Yedekar.[120] Sholay received a special award at the 50th Filmfare Awards in 2005: Best Film of 50 Years.[121]\n", "Sholay has received many \"Best Film\" honours. It was declared the \"Film of the Millennium\" by BBC India in 1999.[15] It topped the British Film Institute's \"Top 10 Indian Films\" of all time poll of 2002,[122] and was voted the greatest Indian movie in a Sky Digital poll of one million British Indians in 2004.[123] It was also included in the magazine Time's \"Best of Bollywood\" list in 2010,[124] and in IBN Live's list of the \"100 greatest Indian films of all time\" in 2013.[125]\n", "Sholay inspired many films and pastiches, and spawned a genre of films, the \"Curry Western\",[126] which is a play on the term Spaghetti Western. A more accurate label for the genre is the Dacoit Western, due to its roots in earlier Indian dacoit films such as Mother India (1957) and Gunga Jumna (1961).[17] It was also an early and most definitive masala film,[127][128] and a trend-setter for \"multi-star\" films.[129] The film was a watershed for scriptwriters in Hindi language films, who were not paid well before Sholay; after the film's success, its writing duo Salim-Javed became stars in their own right and script writing became a more respected profession.[50] The BBC has described Sholay as the \"Star Wars of Bollywood\", comparing its impact on Hindi language films to the impact that Star Wars (1977) later had on Hollywood, while comparing Gabbar Singh to Darth Vader.[130]\n", "Certain scenes and dialogues from the film earned iconic status in India, such as \"Kitne aadmi the\" (How many men were there?), \"Jo dar gaya, samjho mar gaya\" (One who is scared is dead), and \"Bahut yaarana laagta hai\" (Looks like you two are very close) \u2013 all dialogues of Gabbar Singh.[16][131] These and other popular dialogues entered the people's daily vernacular.[132] Characters and dialogues from the film continue to be referred to and parodied in popular culture.[133] Gabbar Singh, the sadistic villain, ushered in an era in Hindi films characterised by \"seemingly omnipotent oppressors as villains\", who play the pivotal role in setting up the context of the story, such as Shakal (played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda) of Shaan (1980), Mogambo (Amrish Puri) of Mr. India (1987) and Bhujang (Amrish Puri) of Tridev (1989).[134] Filmfare, in 2013, named Gabbar Singh the most iconic villain in the history of Indian cinema,[135] and four actors were included in its 2010 list of \"80 Iconic Performances\" for their work in this film.[136][137][138][139]\n", "The film is often credited with making Amitabh Bachchan a \"superstar\", two years after he became a star with Zanjeer (1973).[127][140] Some of the supporting actors remained etched in public memory as the characters they played in Sholay; for example, Mac Mohan continued to be referred to as \"Sambha\", even though his character had just one line.[141] Major and minor characters continue to be used in commercials, promos, films and sitcoms.[50][142] Amjad Khan acted in many villainous roles later in his career. He also played Gabbar Singh again in the 1991 spoof Ramgarh Ke Sholay, and reprised the role in commercials.[143] The British Film Institute in 2002 wrote that fear of Gabbar Singh \"is still invoked by mothers to put their children to sleep\".[144] The 2012 film Gabbar Singh, named after the character, became the highest-grossing Telugu film up to that point.[145] Comedian Jagdeep, who played Soorma Bhopali in the film, attempted to use his Sholay success to create a spinoff. He directed and played the lead role in the 1988 film Soorma Bhopali, in which Dharmendra and Bachchan had cameos.[146]\n", "In 2004, Sholay was digitally remastered and shown again to packed theatres in India, including Mumbai's Minerva, where it had run successfully 29\u00a0years earlier.[147] An attempt to remake Sholay, Ram Gopal Varma's film Aag (2007), starring Amitabh Bachchan as the villain, was a commercial and critical disaster.[148] Because of television and home media, Sholay is widely available and still popular. Twenty years after its release, Sholay was first shown on the Indian DD National television channel, where it drew the highest ratings ever for an Indian film broadcast.[149] Video game producer Mobile2win released the \"Sholay Ramgarh Express\" game for mobile phones in 2004, along with other Sholay themed content such as wallpapers, video clips, and ringtones.[150] Sholay Adventures, a 2014 Indian animated television film adaptation of Sholay aired on Pogo TV.[151] In 2019, a film titled The Sholay Girl, based on the stunt woman Reshma Pathan, was released. Pathan had worked as the body double for Malini in the film.[152]\n", "Sholay has been the subject of two books and many articles. Wimal Dissanayake and Malti Sahai's Sholay, A Cultural Reading (1992) attempts a comprehensive scholarly study that sets the film within the broader history of popular cinema in India. Anupama Chopra's Sholay: The Making of a Classic (2000) provides an inside look at the film's production based on interviews with the director, stars, and crew members.[54][127]\n", "Sholay has been labelled by Chopra as the gold standard in Indian cinema, and a reference point for audiences and trade analysts. Over the years, the film has reached a mythic stature in popular culture,[115] and has been called the greatest Hindi film of all time.[153] It belongs to only a small collection of films, including Kismet (1943), Mother India (1957), Mughal-e-Azam (1960) and Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), which are repeatedly watched throughout India, and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance.[154] The lasting effect of Sholay on Indian cinema was summarised by Anupama Chopra, when in 2004 she called it \"no longer just a film, [but] an event\".[155] In the 2000 book Sholay: The Making of a Classic, the noted director Shekhar Kapur stated \"there has never been a more defining film on the Indian screen. Indian film history can be divided into Sholay BC and Sholay AD\".[156] The film was jointly released in Pakistan by Geo films and Mandviwalla Entertainment on 17 April 2015, almost 40 years after its theatrical release. The film's premiere in the country was held in Karachi.[157]\n", "Screenwriter V. Vijayendra Prasad, responsible for a number of blockbusters in the early 21st century, including the South Indian franchise Baahubali and the Hindi film Bajrangi Bhaijaan (starring Salim's son Salman Khan), cited Sholay as a major inspiration on his work.[158]\n", "Filmmaker Ketan Mehta's company Maya Digital was responsible for converting Sholay into the 3D format.[159] Mehta was approached by G. P. Sippy's grandson, Sasha Sippy, about the project in 2010.[159] In March 2012, Shaan Uttam Singh, the grandson of producer G. P. Sippy, said that he would sponsor a conversion of the film to 3D, and release it in late 2012;[160] this was later postponed to late 2013,[161] and eventually finalised for 3 January 2014.[162] It took \u20b9250 million (US$3.1\u00a0million) to convert Sholay to 3D.[163]\n", "Under the leadership of computer animator Frank Foster, 350 people worked to convert the film into the digital 3D format, for which every scene had to be individually restored, colour-corrected and re-composited in 3D to match the depth.[g][159] New set-pieces, particularly those suited to the new format were also included, such as digital logs which scatter in the direction of the camera during the first half of the film when the train collides with them, the gunshot scene which frees Jai and Veeru from their handcuffs, and panoramic views of Gabbar's hideout in the caves.[159]\n", "The theatrical trailer and release date were unveiled by the original script-writers Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar.[166] The two original leads, Bachchan and Dharmendra, were also involved in promoting the re-release.[167] The film was released in 1,000 screens in India, and additional screens overseas.[164] It earned approximately \u20b9100 million (US$1.3\u00a0million) during its re-release, not enough to recover its conversion cost.[168]\n"], "infobox": "Directed by,Ramesh Sippy \n Produced by,G.

The film also has scenes featuring Buzkashi, a Central Asian sport on horses, including aerial shots, which in turn won the film's cinematographer, Kamal Bose, the Filmfare Award for Best Cinematographer.[1] Dharmatma's plot is loosely based on The Godfather and the character of Premnath was inspired by the life and times of the then king of Matka gambling, Ratan Khatri.[2][3]\n", "Wealthy, powerful, and influential, Seth Dharamdas leads a financially secure life in a palatial bungalow. He is known to come help people who are beyond any hope of assistance, and this leads to him being known as \"Dharmatma\". But Seth Dharamdas does have a number of skeletons in his closet and a parallel life as a gangster and a Matka king. The only person whom he dislikes and fears is his own son Ranbir.\n", "After a heated argument over Dharmatma's matka business, Ranbir leaves home for Afghanistan, where he stays with his uncle and manages his business. One day in a forest, while riding a horse, he finds a nomad, Jankura, and a woman, Reshma, fighting. He defends Reshma and they fall in love.\n", "Meanwhile, in India, his sister Mona, is all set to marry Kundan, the son of their father's old friend. She writes to Ranbir to attend her wedding and give them his blessings. Ranbir accepts her invitation and arrives at the venue. The marriage commences, and Mona departs after the ceremony.

His son-in-law tries to force him to accept the scheme but is unsuccessful. Dharmatma recognises the nature of his son-in-law and apologises for his mistake of letting his daughter marry him. He misses Ranbir and orders his assistant, Vikram Singh, to bring Ranbir back from Afghanistan. Vikram Singh agrees, but on the way, he is kidnapped by Anokhelal's sons, Natwar and Rishi and his brother Biradar.\n", "In Afghanistan, Ranbir and Reshma prepare for their marriage. On the day of the wedding, they leave for the temple. While in the temple, Natwar and Rishi plant a bomb in their jeep, which will explode once the car is started. After praying, Reshma starts the jeep, and it explodes, killing Reshma leaving Ranbir heart-broken.\n", "Natwar and Rishi attack a Matka centre of Dharmatma, injuring him and Kundan. They order a nurse to help Kundan kill Dharmatma. In Afghanistan, Ranbir gets the news of the attack on his father and returns to India. Kundan kills Dharmatma, assisted by the nurse but loses his ring given to him by his wife. Ranbir arrives and finds that his father is dead.

Some days later, Ranbir with Anu, a childhood friend who secretly loves him, goes out for a drive, where he is attacked by goons sent by Anokhelal. The doctor who operated on his father gives him the ring which he found in Dharmatma's hand and tells him that his father died from suffocation. Ranbir suspects a hospital employee to be a part of the conspiracy and asks the doctor about the nurse on duty that night. He visits her house only to find her killed by Natwar and Rishi.

Downstairs, Ranbir accepts the drug deal, which his father declined and provides them with \u20b9 5\u00a0million but on a condition that they will give him Vikram Singh, dead or alive, to which Anokhelal agrees. Anokhelal signals Natwar to stop Kundan from firing at Ranbir, which makes Kundan very angry. He returns home, drunk with a prostitute which makes Mona furious. Drunk and angry, Kundan beats Mona. This infuriates Ranbir. He arrives at their place and beats Kundan, but Mona stops him pleading him not to make her a widow.

Priyadarshi. Santosh\u012b M\u0101 (also called Santoshi Mata) is the goddess of satisfaction.  Usha Mangeshkar, sang the devotional songs for the film along with Mahendra Kapoor and the famous poet Kavi Pradeep, who wrote the lyrics of the songs. Made on a low-budget, the film became one of the most successful films at the box office.[2]\n", "The film opens in the Devaloka, where we witness the \"birth\" of Goddess Santoshi Mata as the daughter of Ganesha, the elephant headed god of good beginnings, his two wives Riddhi and Siddhi (\"prosperity\" and \"spiritual power\"), and as the sister of Kshema and Labha (\"prosperity\" and \"profit\"). Although, Ganesha has another wife Buddhi (\"wisdom\"), she is not portrayed in the film.\n", "A key role is played by the immortal sage Narada, a devotee of Vishnu, and a cosmic busybody who regularly intervenes to advance the film's two parallel plots, which concern both human beings and gods.\n", "We soon meet the 18th-century maiden Satyavati Sharma (Kanan Kaushal), Santoshi Mata's greatest earthly devotee, leading a group of women in an aarti to the goddess. This first song, \"Main To Arti Utaru\" (I perform Mother Santoshi's aarti) exemplifies through its camerawork the experience of darshan \u2014of \"seeing\" and being seen by a deity in the reciprocal act of \"visual communion\" that is central to Hindu worship.\n", "Through the Mother's grace, Satyavati soon falls in love with Brijmohan aka Birju, the youngest of seven brothers in a prosperous Bias Brahmin farmer family, an artistic man, with a talent for singing. Alas, with the boy come the in-laws, and two of Birju's six sisters-in-law, Durga and Maya are jealous shrews who have it in for him and Satyavati from the beginning. To make matters worse, Narada \"stirs up\" the \"jealousy\" of the three principal goddesses, Lakshmi, Parvati, and Saraswati against the \"upstart\" goddess Santoshi Mata. They decide to examine (pariksha) her perseverance or faith (Shraddha) by making life miserable for her chief devotee. Of course, this is all just a charade and the holy goddesses are just acting as if they are jealous of Santoshi Mata to test Satyavati's devotion.\n", "After a fight with his relatives, Birju leaves home to seek his fortune, narrowly escaping a watery grave (planned for him by the goddesses) through his wife's devotion to Santoshi Mata. Nevertheless, the divine ladies convince his family that he is indeed dead, adding the stigma of widowhood to Satyavati's other woes. Her sisters-in-law treat her like a slave, beat and starve her, and a local rogue attempts to rape her; Santoshi Mata rescues her several times. Eventually, Satyavati is driven to attempt suicide, but is stopped by Narada, who tells her about the sixteen-Fridays fast in honour of Santoshi Mata, which can grant any wish. Satyavati completes it with great difficulty and more divine assistance, and just in the nick of time: for the now-prosperous Birju, stricken with amnesia by the goddesses and living in a distant place, has fallen in love with a rich merchant's daughter. Through Santoshi Mata's grace, he gets his memory back and returns home laden with wealth. When he discovers the awful treatment given to his wife, he builds a palatial home for the two of them, complete with an in-house temple to the Holy Mother. Satyavati plans a grand ceremony upon the completion of her fast and invites her in-laws. But the celestials and sadistic sisters-in-law make a last-ditch effort to ruin her by squeezing lime juice into one of the dishes (the rules of Santoshi Mata's fast forbid eating, or serving, any sour or bitter food). All hell breaks loose, before peace is finally restored, on earth as it is in heaven, and a new deity is triumphantly welcomed to the pantheon, as Lakshmi, Saraswati and Parvati have been convinced of Satyavati's devotion.\n", "Song composed by C.

It stars Amitabh Bachchan, Shashi Kapoor, Neetu Singh, Nirupa Roy and Parveen Babi. The film tells the story of a pair of impoverished brothers who, after their family is betrayed by the misplaced idealism of their father, struggle to survive in the slums of Bombay, and eventually find themselves on opposing sides of the law.[10][11][12] The Deewaar (\"wall\") of the title is the wall that has sprung up between the two brothers, drawn apart by fate and circumstances in a time of socio-political turmoil.[13][14]\n", "Upon release, Deewaar was both critically and commercially successful, with praise going towards the film's screenplay, story, and music, as well as the performances of the acting ensemble, particularly Bachchan, Kapoor and Roy's performances. It is often considered a ground-breaking cinematic masterpiece, with Indiatimes ranking Deewaar amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films,[15] as well as being one of three Hindi-language films to be included on the list of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.\n", "The film had a significant impact on Indian cinema, as well as wider Indian society, with the film's anti-establishment themes and Bachchan's criminal anti-hero vigilante character resonating with audiences,[16] cementing Bachchan's popular image as the \"angry young man\" of Bollywood cinema.[17][18] Forbes included Bachchan's performance in the film on its list, \"25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema\".[19] The film also cemented the success of the writing duo Salim-Javed, who went on to write many more blockbuster films; the value of film writers skyrocketed thanks to Salim-Javed, who were paid as highly as leading actors at the time.[20] Deewaar's influence also extends to world cinema, influencing films from Hong Kong[21] and British cinema.[13]\n", "The film opens with a depiction of the strong leadership of trade unionist Anand Verma, who works hard to enhance the lives of struggling laborers. He lives in a modest home with his wife Sumitra Devi, and their two young sons Vijay and Ravi. However, things take a turn for the worse when Anand is blackmailed by a corrupt businessman who threatens to kill his family if Anand does not cease his protest activities. Forced into compliance, Anand is thus attacked by the very same laborers who jeer him for his betrayal, who are unaware that he was blackmailed to do so. His family is also persecuted by the angry workers. Out of shame, Anand leaves town, leaving Sumitra to care for their sons alone in poverty. Several of the angry workers kidnap Vijay and tattoo his arm with the Hindi words \"\u092e\u0947\u0930\u093e \u092c\u093e\u092a \u091a\u094b\u0930 \u0939\u0948\" (mer\u0101 b\u0101p chor hai; my father is a thief). Not knowing what else to do, Sumitra brings her children to Mumbai and struggles as a day laborer to care for her sons.\n", "As the boys grow up to be young men, Vijay grows up with an acute awareness of his father's failure as he has been victimized for his father's supposed misdeeds. In the process of fighting for his rights, Vijay starts out as a boot polisher and later becomes a dockyard worker. When Vijay beats up several thugs working for the ruthless crime lord Samant, this influences one of Samant's rivals Mulk Raj Daavar to bring Vijay to his inner circle. When Vijay successfully completes a task in nabbing several of Samant's goods for Daavar, the latter rewards him with money, allowing Vijay to buy a palatial home for his family. While continuing on his assignments for Daavar, Vijay also sacrifices his own education so Ravi can study.\n", "As Ravi finishes his studies, he starts dating Veera Narang, the daughter of Police Commissioner DCP Narang. On the Commissioner's suggestion, Ravi applies for employment with the police and is sent for training. Several months later, he is accepted by the police and earns the rank of Sub-Inspector. When Ravi returns home, his first assignment is to apprehend and arrest some of Bombay's hardcore criminals and smugglers, which includes his brother, Vijay\u00a0\u2013 much to his shock, as he had never associated his own brother with criminal activities. Ravi must now decide between apprehending Vijay and quitting the police force. At first, Ravi is reluctant of arresting his brother, but he is later moved when he non-fatally shoots a boy who stole two rotis in an attempt to catch him. When a remorseful Ravi goes to the boy's family by giving them some food and confessing what he did, the mother berates Ravi while the boy's father sends her back to the room. The father forgives Ravi and justifies his action by saying that stealing of a 'lakh' or of food is the same, which finally motivates Ravi to agree to take the case.\n", "When Ravi finds out that Vijay has acquired wealth by crime, he decides to move out along with Sumitra (who too is disgusted), causing a feud to develop between Vijay and Ravi. Around the same time, Anand is found dead inside a train, and his body is cremated by Vijay. Ravi then takes the opportunity to complete his task in taking down and arresting many associates from both Samant and Daavar's gangs; even Daavar himself ends up being arrested by Ravi. Fuming over the loss of his family and many of his associates, Vijay enters into a relationship with a woman named Anita, whom he meets at a bar. When Anita falls pregnant with Vijay's child, Vijay decides to abandon his life in the underworld so that he can marry her, confess his sins, and seek forgiveness from Sumitra and Ravi. However, Samant and his remaining goons arrive and murder Anita, provoking an enraged Vijay to brutally murder Samant and his remaining goons in revenge, leading himself to be branded a criminal forever.\n", "Upon hearing about what happened following the deaths of Samant and his gang, Ravi meets with Vijay in a final clash, pleading him to stop running and surrender himself. Vijay refuses and ends up being fatally shot in the arm by Ravi while escaping to a temple where he reunites with Sumitra and pleads forgiveness. Vijay then dies in Sumitra's arms, leaving her extremely shattered. Around the same time, Ravi arrives to the temple and is completely distraught over what he has done to Vijay. The film ends with the police hosting a celebration for Ravi for his successful acts of pursuing justice and taking down the criminals, though Ravi is still wracked with remorse for killing Vijay.\n", "Additionally Vikas Anand, Mohan Sherry, Manik Irani Kamal Kapoor, A. K. Hangal, Dulari, and Satyadev Dubey all appear in minor and cameo roles. In the song \"Koi Mar Jaye\", Aruna Irani appears as a guest dancer.\n", "The film's screenplay, story and dialogues were written by Salim\u2013Javed (Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar). The main inspiration for the film's plot was the 1961 Dilip Kumar film Gunga Jumna (1961), which had a similar premise of two brothers on opposing sides of the law, with the elder criminal brother as the main character.\nThe role of Amitabh Bachchan is partially based on Karna from the Mahabharata whereas Shashi Kapoor resembles Yudhisthira from the Mahabharata.[22][23] Deewaar is thus considered to be a spiritual successor to Gunga Jumna.[24] Salim-Javed credited Gunga Jumna as well as Mehboob Khan's Mother India (1957) as the main inspirations for Deewaar, which they described as a \"more urban, much more contemporary\" take on their themes; while Mother India and Gunga Jumna took place in a rural context, Salim\u2013Javed reinterpreted their themes in a contemporary urban context with Deewaar.[25]\n", "Amitabh Bachchan's character, Vijay, was loosely inspired by the real-life Bombay underworld gangster Haji Mastan.[13][14] Vijay's story arc in the film parallels that of Mastan's life, such as the rise from a humble dockyard coolie worker to a powerful smuggler,[14][26] and Mastan's rivalry with smuggler Sukkur Narayan Bakhia is similar to Vijay's rivalry with Samant (Madan Puri).[14]\n", "Salim\u2013Javed's screenplay had dynamic dialogues and incorporated a number of symbolic motifs. For example, the scene where the two brothers meet as adults takes place under a bridge, symbolizing a bridge forming between the brothers.[16] Set in the Dharavi slums of Bombay, the film's story of gangsters in Dharavi was a critique of socio-political inequality and injustice in Bombay.[12] The characterisations of the two brothers are sociologically contextualised to represent a form of urban conflict and drama, aimed at presenting a causal explanation for the sequence of events and Vijay's social alienation, with the narrative explaining his every action and decision, grounded in his memories and experiences.[11]\n", "The script generally has an atmosphere of secularism, while incorporating subtle religious motifs.[16] The mother Sumitra Devi (Nirupa Roy) and police brother Ravi (Shashi Kapoor) are religious Hindus, whereas the criminal brother Vijay (Bachchan) is generally not religious and \"upset with God\", yet he carries a badge numbered 786, which the Muslim Rahim Chacha (Yunus Parvez) points out to be a number of religious significance in Islam[16] (representing Bismillah) and has its own sub-plot.[21] The 786 badge plays a powerful and symbolic role in several scenes,[16] saving Vijay at key moments[27] and signifying something ominous when he loses it.[16]\n", "Salim-Javed initially showed the script to Bachchan, who they had in mind for Vijay's role after having worked with him on Zanjeer (1973). At the time, Bachchan was working on another film with Yash Chopra, and told him about the script. After some initial scepticism, Chopra was eventually convinced to direct the film after Salim-Javed narrated the storyline to him.[16]\n", "Bachchan's \"angry young man\" performance as Vijay in the film was inspired by Dilip Kumar's intense performance as Gunga in Gunga Jumna, which Bachchan sharpened and reinterpreted in a contemporary urban context reflecting the changing socio-political climate of 1970s India.[28][29]\n", "Salim-Javed \"felt only Bachchan could do justice to Vijay's role.\" According to Akhtar, they \"saw his talent, which most makers didn't. He was exceptional, a genius actor who was in films that weren't good.\" At Salim-Javed's insistence, Bachchan was cast in the role.[16] Director Yash Chopra's first choices for Vijay and Ravi's roles were Dev Anand and Rajesh Khanna respectively. After Anand rejected the script, casting plans changed and Khanna was to play Vijay and Navin Nischol was considered for Ravi. However, Salim-Javed had Amitabh Bachchan and Shatrughan Sinha in mind when they wrote the script; Sinha turned down the film when he heard Khanna was initially cast in the lead, due to a fallout between the two. Nirupa Roy's role as Sumitra Devi was also first offered to Vyjayanthimala; Nischol and Vyjayanthimala turned down the film after they found out Khanna would no longer be in the film. Shashi Kapoor was subsequently cast as Ravi, and Nirupa Roy as Sumitra Devi.[30]\n", "In 2014, Bachchan revealed that his iconic look in the film\u00a0\u2013 a \"denim blue shirt worn with khakee pants and a rope dangling over the shoulder\"\u00a0\u2013 was the result of a mistake by the tailor. He said, \"The knotted shirt and rope on the shoulder in [Deewaar] was an adjustment for an error in stitching, shirt too long so knotted it\".[31] In certain scenes, Bachchan had some input on Chopra's direction, such as the father's funeral scene where Bachchan, instead of lighting the pyre with his right hand, suggests to use his left hand to show off the tattoo, \"Mera baap chor hai\" (\"My father is a thief\").[16] The film was shot mostly at night because Bachchan was shooting for Ramesh Sippy's Sholay at that time.[32]\n", "The film contains a fight scene,[33] which involves Bachchan performing martial arts sequences inspired by Hong Kong martial arts cinema, which Deewaar was one of the first to do in Indian cinema.[34][35] Rather than following the Hollywood model, it follows the Hong Kong model, with an emphasis on acrobatics and stunts. The style of fighting seen in Deewaar combined kung fu (as it was perceived by Indians) with Indian martial arts (particularly Indian wrestling).[36]\n", "The soundtrack of the movie was composed by R. D. Burman, and the lyrics were penned by Sahir Ludhianvi. The soundtrack received praise.\n", "The Hindu epic Mahabharata was the sole inspiration for the plot. Amitabh Bachchan's character, who rises from the low streets to becoming among the top influential businessmen, is based on Karna, the main protagonist of the Mahabharata. The role of Nirupa Roy resembles Kunti, Karna's mother. Shashi Kapoor plays Arjuna, Karna's younger brother.\n", "It was one of the three Hindi films featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, the others being Kalyug (1981) which itself was inspired by Mahabharata and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995).[37]\n", "At the Indian box office, the film grossed \u20b975 million[38] ($9\u00a0million).[a] In Bombay alone, the film grossed \u20b910 million.[40] In terms of footfalls, the film sold an estimated 31 million tickets at an average 1975 price of \u20b92.40 per ticket.[41] Adjusted for inflation, this is equivalent to an estimated \u20b94.17 billion ($64 million) at an average 2017 price of \u20b9134.38 per ticket.[42]\n", "Numerous DVD editions entered the market by companies like \"Eros Entertainment\", \"Shemaroo Entertainment\" and \"Eagle Home Video\". These were released as non-restored, non re-mastered editions and bare bones, void of supplementary features. Eagle Home Video came out with a restored edition of this movie, preserving the original aspect ratio in a 4:3 pillar box and a DTS Master Audio (HD) in 2.0. The restoration took place in Shemaroo studios.[citation needed]\n", "Upon release, Deewaar was a major commercial success, ranking as the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of 1975,[43] and received critical acclaim, with critics praising the story, dialogue, screenplay, as well as the performances of the cast, particularly those of Bachchan, Kapoor and Roy. Indiatimes ranks Deewaar amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films.[15] It was one of the three Hindi films featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, the others being Mother India (1957) and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995).[44]\n", "It was perceived by audiences to be anti-establishment, while Amitabh Bachchan's character Vijay was seen as a vigilante angry hero, establishing Bachchan's image as the \"angry young man\" of Indian cinema.[16] With the unprecedented growth of slums across India at the time, Vijay was seen as a new kind of hero, with his suppressed rage giving a voice to the angst of the urban poor.[11][12] Deewaar is also remembered for its iconic dialogues written by Salim-Javed. The most famous is when Shashi Kapoor delivers the line, \"Mere paas maa hai\" (\"I have mother\"), a line that is widely known in India and has become part of Indian popular culture.[45] The film Loins of Punjab Presents (2007) mocked how the line is sometimes wrongly attributed to Amitabh Bachchan.[46] It also established Parveen Babi as the \"new Bollywood woman\".[47]\n", "The film cemented the success of the writing duo Salim-Javed, who went on to write many more blockbuster films. After the success of this film, the value of film writers skyrocketed thanks to Salim-Javed, and they soon were being paid as highly as some actors at the time.[20] Amitabh Bachchan described Salim-Javed's screenplay for Deewaar as \"the perfect script\"[16] and \"the best screenplay ever\" in Indian cinema.[9] Deewaar, one of the first Indian films with an action sequence modelled after Hong Kong martial arts cinema, popularised the use of martial arts sequences in Bollywood films from the 1970s to the 1990s.[34] The style of fighting popularised by Deewaar, with acrobatics and stunts, and combining Chinese kung fu (as it was perceived by Indians, based on 1970s Hong Kong films) with Indian pehlwani wrestling, became the standard model for Bollywood action scenes up until the 1990s.[36]\n", "The film was later remade in Telugu as Magaadu (1976), in Tamil as Thee (1981), in Malayalam as Nathi Muthal Nathi Vare (1983), in Persian as Koose-ye Jonoob (1978), and in Turkish as Ac\u0131lar\u0131n \u00c7ocu\u011fu (1985). The Brothers, a 1979 Hong Kong film produced by the Shaw Brothers Studio, is a remake of this film.[21] Another remake of Deewaar was the 1994 Bollywood film Aatish: Feel the Fire, starring Sanjay Dutt as the older criminal brother, Atul Agnihotri as the younger police brother, and Tanuja as the mother.[48] Hong Kong's Shaw Brothers studio remade Deewaar as The Brothers (1979),[21] which in turn inspired John Woo's internationally acclaimed breakthrough A Better Tomorrow (1986).[49] The Brothers also starred a Hong Kong actor that would later be known for heroic bloodshed films, Danny Lee (playing Shashi Kapoor's character), with a police officer persona later seen in Hong Kong crime films such as Woo's The Killer (1989).[21]\n", "Deewaar had an influence on Hong Kong cinema and in turn Hollywood cinema, by playing a key role in the creation of the heroic bloodshed crime genre of 1980s Hong Kong action cinema.[49] Deewaar, along with several later 1970s \"angry young man\" epics it inspired, such as Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), had similarities to elements later seen in 1980s Hong Kong heroic bloodshed films.[50]\n", "British director Danny Boyle described Deewaar as being \"absolutely key to Indian cinema\" and cited the film as an influence on his Academy Award winning film Slumdog Millionaire (2008).[13] The film's co-director Loveleen Tandan noted that \"Simon Beaufoy studied Salim-Javed's kind of cinema minutely.\"[51] Actor Anil Kapoor noted that some scenes of Slumdog Millionaire \"are like Deewaar, the story of two brothers of whom one is completely after money while the younger one is honest and not interested in money.\"[52] Slumdog Millionaire, which pays homage to Amitabh Bachchan, has a similar narrative structure to Deewaar. Composer A. R. Rahman referenced the film in his Oscar acceptance speech.[46]\n", "Deewaar received the Filmfare Best Movie Award of 1976, and also won six more Filmfare Awards for Best Screenplay, Best Dialogue, Best Director, Best Sound, Best Story, and Best Supporting Actor (Kapoor), and received two other nominations for Best Actor (Bachchan) and Best Supporting Actress (Roy).[53]\n"], "infobox": "Directed by,Yash Chopra \n Produced by,Gulshan Rai \n Starring,\n,Amitabh Bachchan,\n,Shashi Kapoor,\n,Neetu Singh,\n,Nirupa Roy,\n,Parveen Babi,\n \n Music by,Rahul Dev Burman \n Box office,\u20b9,75 million,[3]"}

In return, an incensed maulvi canes him on the hand. But it is Laila's hand which starts bleeding. Incidents such as this, spread like wild fire and Laila's father, scared for his daughter's reputation, decides to stop her from going to school. The two clan heads decide to separate their children as it is impossible for them to conceive of the Sharwaris and the Amaris ever being joined by love instead of blood. Laila and her Majnu grow up in different places.\n", "Many years later, Qais and his friends visit Laila's town to buy camels and the stage is set for the two lovers to meet again. One day at the marketplace, they encounter each other and it is love at first sight for both of them. They start meeting each other secretly, all over again. But the villain makes his entry in the form of Laila's hot-tempered brother Tabrez (Ranjeet). He has already had a spat with Qais, with neither knowing the other's true identity. In the turn of events that follow, Qais's father dies at the hands of Tabrez. Qais in turn, avenges his father's murder by killing Tabrez. He is exiled from the town and wanders about in the dunes, like a madman, thirsting for just a look of his beloved. Meanwhile, Laila is married off to a prince, Bakhsh (Danny). Learning of her love for Qais, he promises to keep his distance until such time that he is not able to replace Majnu in Laila's heart.

Also, Kishanlal took in Robert's daughter Jenny as his own and sent her off for her studies abroad. Kishanlal and his men are forced to flee during a police raid at their loading dock, allowing Robert to escape with another shipment of smuggled gold after shooting Superintendent Khanna. With the new gold, Robert regains his position as crime lord and hires new mobsters with the intent of retrieving Jenny and getting vengeance on Kishanlal.\n", "As the story unfolds, each of the brothers find themselves falling in love: Amar falls in love with a small-time crook Lakshmi after arresting her abusive stepmother, Akbar falls in love with a doctor named Salma Ali, and Anthony falls in love with Jenny at a church sermon on Easter Sunday. Bharati eventually regains her eyesight during a festival honoring the Sai Baba of Shirdi which is hosted by Akbar, whom she recognizes as her youngest son Raju. Around the same time, Akbar saves Salma and her father Taiyyab from a house fire, and Taiyyab gratefully gives blessings to Akbar and Salma's relationship. This event led to both Amar and Akbar learning that Kishanlal and Bharati are their parents and that they're brothers.\n", "However, things take a drastic turn when Kishanlal gets betrayed by one of his bodyguards Zebisco, who kidnaps Jenny and sells her out to Robert in exchange for her hand in marriage. Father Gonsalves attempts to rescue Jenny, but ends up being murdered by Robert; even Lakshmi also ends up being kidnapped by her evil stepbrother Ranjeet, who works for Robert as well. Upon hearing what happened to Father Gonsalves, Anthony soon learns that Kishanlal and Bharati are his parents and that both Amar and Akbar are his brothers. With the knowledge that they are related and realizing what just happened, the brothers are determined to make Robert and his men pay for their crimes. As such, Amar, Akbar, and Anthony disguise themselves and enter Robert's house along with Salma, who helps Jenny and Lakshmi escape. The brothers then reveal themselves before beating Robert and his men (including Ranjeet and Zebisco) and having them all arrested for their crimes.

However, Amar Akbar Anthony was slated to release in 1975, prior to Talash's release.[10][11]\n", "Prayag Raj wrote the film's screenplay, while Kader Khan wrote the dialogue.[12]\n", "The character of Anthony Gonsalves was named after the famous composer and teacher of the same name, whose pupils included Pyarelal (of Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal, the composer duo of the film) and R.

Some exterior and interior shots were filmed at the Mount Mary Church in Bandra, Mumbai and at the Don Bosco School, Wadala, Mumbai respectively.[13][16] Shooting was scheduled so that the entire cast didn't have to appear together except for the climactic sequence and the title song (\"Anhoni Ko Honi\"), where they all perform as a group. However, the shooting went over schedule, which required Rishi Kapoor and Shabana Azmi to shoot their scenes separately so they could leave towards the end of production to work on other films.\n", "Amar Akbar Anthony incorporates a strong element of secularism[17] within a Bollywood masala film. Analysts such as Virdi (2003) and Kavoori & Punathambekar (2008) opine that the themes of Desai's \"magnum opus\" include religious pluralism and secular nationalism.[18][19] Philip Lutgendorf hints that the separation of the three children on Indian Independence Day is akin to the Partition of India.[20] Similarly, Vijay Mishra (2013) argues that the film reaffirmed India's \"liberal ethos.\"\n[21] The three religions represented by the titular characters are the \"pillars of the nation:\" when they work together, they can restore life to their mother (represented when they donate blood during the opening title sequence) and beat any evil (symbolised by their common villain).[22] The characters' reunion with their parents completes the nationalistic allegory,[18][19] suggesting that what was lost at independence can be regained.[23]\n", "The film's masala style is evident in its plot and characters. According to Varia (2013), Amar Akbar Anthony was conceived as a tragedy but later incorporated many other genres.[24] Dickson (2016) commented that the film featured a plot which would \"give even Shakespeare migraines.\"[25] Some authors also highlight the archetypal character of the suffering and self-sacrificing mother (Roy).[26] However, Dinesh Raheja concludes that \"ultimately, the show belongs to Amitabh Bachchan. In a tailor-made role, he has the audience in stitches. Despite his playing an implausible character, one quickly surrenders one's reservations in favour of a rollicking romp.\"[27]\n", "Amar Akbar Anthony's soundtrack was composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, with lyrics penned by Anand Bakshi.

Dharma heroically saves the lives of Ajit (Anwar Hussain), Sujit (Sujit Kumar) and Suresh when they are being attacked by a tiger and they graciously offer him a job in Bombay (now Mumbai) whenever he decides to visit. When the village experiences an economic crisis and drought, the family migrates to Bombay, where Ajit makes Dharma the manager of his warehouse in the city.\n", "Dharma is very honest with his job and courteous as well. After a few months, Dharma is tricked into signing a document which makes him the owner of the warehouse he is working at. One fine day the police raid his warehouse and he is arrested for trafficking gold and drugs. \nBeing a village simpleton he doesn't understand the law and is easily implicated by his bosses for illegal activities carried out by them.\n", "His pleas of innocence are ignored by the judge and he is sentenced to 18 months in jail plus an additional six months for contempt of court. Sujit visits his destitute family and offers money as compensation for the false implication of Dharma. His wife Radha refuses this, saying that she would not touch ill-gotten wealth. She toils very hard, working as a maid in the neighbourhood and stitching clothes for the locals. The hard work takes a toll on her health, as she is pregnant and one day she falls off the stairs due to weakness. She is admitted to the hospital and her sister-in-law Laxmi is the only person around. The doctor gives her a prescription. Laxmi finds herself helpless in this situation and goes to Sujit for money. Although Sujit gives her money, he rapes her before that. Laxmi, in a desolate state, reaches the hospital with the medicines. She hands over it to Dharma, who is out on parole and she dies in his arms (out of poison she had consumed earlier). When Dharma enters the ward, he finds out that their baby has died due to a fall Radha has suffered. He is totally heartbroken.\n", "On his return, his bosses meet him and offer him anything he wishes in compensation. He rejects their offer saying that he would want his baby and sister as compensation. The prison and his hardships have now made him a ruthless man. His bosses sense vengeance and lodge a complaint to Inspector Khan, who had earlier arrested him. After a couple of days of his release, Dharma treads out late in the night from his home. His wife attempts to ask him where he is going, to which he replies that henceforth she should not ask him any questions. He straight away heads to Sujit's home and is able to get into his bedroom. Dharma demands all his money as compensation. Sujit agrees to it. Dharma then makes him write a confession letter, in case Sujit complains against him in the police. Sujit writes of all the crimes he has committed against Dharma and hands it over to him. Once this is done, he hangs Sujit from the fan and makes it appear as a suicide.\n", "Inspector Khan straight away heads to Dharma's home and questions him. Dharma replies that unless he has any evidence against him, he should not question him. Radha understands that Dharma has killed Sujit, but keeps mum. In order to remove any suspicion about the robbery, Dharma hands over all the money to the owner of a hotel as a security deposit to lease his hotel. The deal is that Dharma would pay a paltry sum Rs. 500/month as the lease. A formal agreement is done. Inspector Khan questions the owner and suspects foul play, but due to proper paperwork and lack of evidence, he cannot implicate either of them.\n", "Ajit, now scared of Dharma decides to kill him. He plants a bomb in his home to blow up his whole family. Alert Dharma is able to save his family, but is severely injured. Inspector Khan warns him that although he doesn't have any evidence, the path that Dharma has chosen would lead him back to his own destruction. Next, Dharma targets Suresh. He goes to his home and makes him drink excessive alcohol. Once Suresh is drunk, he gets all his money and information about their illegal business. Once that is done, he pushes him from the stairs to make it appear as an accident. Yet again, Khan visits him in the hospital and tries to reason with Dharma to dissuade him from his path. As Inspector Khan doesn't have any evidence, yet again he returns empty handed. \nOnce out of the hospital, Dharma kills Ajit and starts trading with the peddler whom Ajit traded with. In order to keep the bad influence away from his kid, Dharma sends his son Raju to London for his further education. Years later, Raju (also Amitabh Bachchan) returns home and would like to marry Geeta Verma, (Neetu Singh) whom he met in London, but is unable to meet his father's approval and comes into conflict. Dharma had promised his business partner that he would marry Raju to his daughter. His business partner Rajan was a former employee of Ajit. Rajan runs all the risk as Dharma is officially not a partner of the business and Rajan is facing all the court cases related to their illegal faction of the business. After a certain point, Dharma reconciles with his son and realises that his consent to marriage is equally important. He tells Rajan that he would not be able to fulfill his promise.\n", "Rajan becomes distraught with this and the thought of betrayal starts slipping into his mind. Unknown to Dharma, Ajit is still alive and has returned and it is time to avenge the past by trying to murder Dharma at any price. Rajan sides with Ajit and attempts to kill Dharma, and in a failed attempt kills his wife instead. Dharma now realizes the bitter truth behind Khan's warning leading to his self-destruction.

This prompts Roma and Don's gang, currently led by Don's right-hand-man Narang (Kamal Kapoor) to kidnap Vijay from the hospital and take him to their hideout, allowing him to infiltrate the gang under the guise of having amnesia.\n", "Around the same time, a poor widower Jasjit (Pran) is released from prison after being arrested by DSP D'Silva few years ago for a past robbery he was involved in along with Narang. Jasjit took the job only with the intention of using the money to save his ill wife from death, but was caught by D'Silva in the act which resulted in his wife's death. He also intends to reunite with his children ,Deepu and Munni who are currently being taken care of by Vijay as they went missing after Jasjit's arrest.  \n", "As part of his mission, Vijay finds a red diary containing all the addresses and contacts of the criminals and even the evidences regarding their activities. He replaces the diary with a blank one and heads to DSP D'Silva's house to hand him over the real diary. While Vijay is climbing to D'Silva's apartment, Roma chases him and attacks him in an attempt to avenge both Ramesh and Kamini's deaths. Vijay survives the attack and tries to explain to Roma that he is not Don but she refuses to believe him. DSP D'Silva intervenes and confesses about Don's death to Roma, who apologises to Vijay and agrees to help him out in taking down the gang members. Using the diary, DSP D'Silva learns that all of the gang members are working for a notorious crime lord Vardhaan Makhija who is serving as the source of crime in Mumbai (even Don and Narang are nothing more than just middlemen reporting to Vardhaan). Despite this, there is no indicaofon in finding out Vardhaan's ide,ntity as it remains unknown. Meanwhile, Vijay announces to the gang members that he has regained his memory after learning more and more about Don's past through the diary. \n", "However, things take a drastic turn when the police, acting upon Vijay's information, raid the hideout during the celebrations and DSP D'Silva, the only witness to Vijay's true identity, is shot in the crossfire while Vijay and the gang members are arrested as Inspector Verma and Malik mistake Vijay for Don. In the hospital, Vijay desperately tries to make a gravely injured DSP D'Silva confess that he is not Don. Unfortunately, DSP D'Silva dies from his serious injuries ,and Vijay is imprisoned. He is forced to escape from the police truck while on the way to a high-security jail, and the commotion causes Narang and the gang members to finally learn that Vijay is an imposter, just as they too escape from captivity, swearing to kill him. \n", "Tangled in a web of confusion where the police refuse to believe he is Vijay while the gang members realise he is indeed not Don, Vijay learns that the diary (the sole evidence to prove his innocence) is stolen by Jasjit in order to track down Deepu and Munni. He meets Vijay and Roma who team up with him. However, the trio learn sthat Malik himself is actually Vardhaan who captured the real R.K. Malik (Pinchoo Kapoor) and posed as the latter to cover his crime, and that Vardhaan was the one who had murdered DSP D'Silva during the raid-up and had already exposed Roma's identity to the gang members, before having them kidnap Deepu and Munni so that the trio can surrender themselves and the diary to Vardhaan. After being captured by Vardhaan, Jasjit is reunited with Deepu and Munni and manages to escape the hideout with them, thanking Vijay for taking care of his children. \n", "Meeting up in the same graveyard where Don was buried, Vardhaan and his gang members who are holding Deepu and Munni hostages, have a long standoff with Vijay, Roma and Jasjit, resulting in Vardhaan grabbing the diary from Roma and throwing it in a fire. Eventually, he calls Inspector Verma and the police to the scene to have the trio and the gang members arrested so that he can get away scot-free. However, anticipating the possibility that Vardhaan would try to escape, Vijay cleverly reveals that the diary that he had thrown in the fire was actually the blank one that he had switched, just as he hands over the real diary to Verma, exposing Vardhaan's identity and occupation to the police. Eventually, Vardhaan and the gang members are arrested and sent to prison for their crimes ,while all charges against Vijay are dropped. The film ends with Vijay, Roma, Jasjit, Deepu and Munni happily walking away from the police station, satisfied that they took down Vardhaan and his gang members for good.\n", "Producer and cinematographer Nariman Irani was in a financial mess when his film Zindagi Zindagi (1972), starring Sunil Dutt flopped.
